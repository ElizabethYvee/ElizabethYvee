<h2>About Me</h2>
Technical author by day, data dork by night! I love learning and applying technical skills to real-world, people-facing problems. 

<br></br>

<h2>Data Projects</h2>
I tend to work with real datasets to answer questions about my interests and solve problems. The scope of this is pretty broad, and hopefully interesting! 
<br></br>
I primarily use R and Python for my projects.
